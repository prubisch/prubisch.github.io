I am a PostDoctoral researcher in the group of Melanie Stefan at Medical School Berlin. My research is focused on models of synaptic plasticity in multi-scale models to investigate the functional role of synaptic heterogeneity. Previously I have worked on voltage-dependent plasticity which sparked my interest for the role of inhibitory regulation of long term plasticity.
