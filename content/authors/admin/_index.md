I am a PostDoctoral researcher in the group of Melanie Stefan at Medical School Berlin working on computaitonal models of synaptic plasticity. My research interest is focused on the biological processes of learning. I hope to elucidate the role of temporal and spatial signalling/filters within the plasticity cascades in health and disease. My approach uses modelling tools and abstractions in order to translate the highly detailed biologically-plausible models and results into functional learning rules suitable for large network simulations. I studied functional development in spiking neural networks during my PhD at the University of Edinburgh under supervision of Matthias Hennig.

 I believe that the transfer of knowledge and inter-disciplinary communication is central for the scientific process and reducing boundaries. Therefore, I try to take part in science outreach and teaching in online accessible courses e.g. Neuromatch. At Medical School Berlin, I organise the INBICA Journal Club to facilitate interdisciplinary communication between researchers within the Institute for Neuroscience and Biopsychology for Clinical Application. I am also the postdoc representative of the Bernstein Network.
